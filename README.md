# AGame-ItsAGame
I swear it's a game.

It's been a year since I last made a game of any scale. This game is sure to blow the rest of my games out of the water, so I've created a new repository. Actually, I forgot my password. That's why I have a new one. You can see my old games at @corbbing

# What is this game?

It's a real time strategy game. You can own a kingdom, and interact with others. Do they know what you're doing? Maybe, maybe not. Only time will tell, and only _you_ can decide.

Edit:

You own a kingdom. It is your duty to protect your home from invaders, poverty and famine. You are to grow your kingdom fast enough that your land is able to provide for you throughout the seasons. If you do not want to take the land by force, you can begin trades and at some point, reduce the costs of delivering goods. You can either sell or trade goods, too.

Your relations with the other lands depend greatly on your survival. You'll need to figure out your enemy's ties and pull strings to either destroy them or get them to ally with you.

This game was inspired by a theoretical battle whereby a clan publicizes the hatred of another to draw in the hundreds of thousands of troops as aid from a neighboring country, only to turn on all of them as they pass through their territory. This game is built to withstand that kind of largescale deception.

## The thought experiment #1:

Three regions lie on an large island in the middle of an ocean. The region to the South will go to great lengths to defeat their enemies, able to move hundreds of troops hundreds of miles an any direction. The regions to the north, would rather hold their ground, and will fight hard together to defend their territory. These northerly regions stand together, often collaborating to take down an enemy. What is the strategy they could use to defeat the region to the south?

The answer:

Because the southerly region is willing to fight on enemy territory, they are fighting on unfamiliar territory. Any strategy that takes advantage of this situation would do.

Here's one:

The middle region, between the north and the south could fake an alliance to the south, and publicize rumors show hatred for the northern region. After some time, and threats and taunts from the northern region, the southern region would attack through the middle region. They could send troops through this area, while the middle region and the northern region band together to destroy the southern region's army.

## Thought experiment 2

A wealthy nation with a large population want's to incorporate a smaller more poor nation that has denied any form of aid, and wants to keep its ways and traditions, to the point where it becomes deterimental to their own existence.

The point is to make the poor country give up its ways so they can progress as a society, and contribute to the wealthy nation.

The wealthy nation is located south of a group of six poor nations, the one as mentioned in the above, lying smack-dab in the middle. 

These smaller nations are more agreeable, but have strong ties and trade routes with the middle nation. In fact, the smaller center nation is dependent on these areas for their resource-rich land.


```

+----------+----------+----------+
| Nation 1 | Nation 2 | Nation 3 |
+----------+----------+----------+
| Nation 4 |  Target  | Nation 5 |
+----------+----------+----------+
| Nation 6 | Homeland | Nation 7 |
+----------+----------+----------+


```

Answer: surround the middle nation, and cut off all trade until they cannot sustain themselves. They will ask for aid.
