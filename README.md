# AGame-ItsAGame
I swear it's a game.

It's been a year since I last made a game of any scale. This game is sure to blow the rest of my games out of the water, so I've created a new repository. Actually, I forgot my password. That's why I have a new one. You can see my old games at @corbbing

# What is this game?

It's a real time strategy game. You can own a kingdom, and interact with others. Do they know what you're doing? Maybe, maybe not. Only time will tell, and only _you_ can decide.

This game was inspired by a theoretical battle whereby a clan publicizes the hatred of another to draw in the hundreds of thousands of troops as aid from a neighboring country, only to turn on all of them as they pass through their territory. This game is built to withstand that kind of largescale deception.
